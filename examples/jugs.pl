 %% Problem:
 %% Write the prolog code for the water jugs problem:
 %% There are two jugs, one holding 3 and the other 5 gallons of water.
 %% A number of things can be done with the jugs:  they can be filled,
 %% emptied, and dumped one into the other either until the poured-into
 %% jug is full or until the poured-out-of jug is empty.  Devise a
 %% sequence of actions that will produce 4 gallons of water in the larger
 %% jug. Note that only integer values of water will be used.


 %% First of all, the problem, as I see it, is badly specified; if 4
 %% gallons of water have to remain in the larger jug, there is a smaller
 %% jug, isn't it? The text you posted (above) does not mention anything
 %% about it, but I vaguely understand that the jugs can contain 5 and 3
 %% gallons of water, so they both are full at the beginning. Well, let's
 %% start... 

 %% I prefer clear code as long as it does not impede performance...

 %% The basic data structure is a functor
 %% 
 %% jug(Water)
 %% 
 %% and the state of the problem is given by
 %% 
 %% state(SmallJug, LargeJug)
 %% 
 %% Actions are described as functors of the form
 %% 
 %% action(Action, Jug, Amount)
 %% 
 %% or
 %%
 %% action(Action, Jug)
 %% 
 %% where Amount refers to an integer number of gallons of water,
 %% Jug can be small or large and action can be empty, fill and pour, the
 %% latter meaning that the jug alluded to is poured a given amount of water
 %% into the other jug.
 %%
 %% The solution is given as a list of functors of the form
 %%
 %% step(Action, Resulting)
 %%
 %% Its meaning is obvious.
