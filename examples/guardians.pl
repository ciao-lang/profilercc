 %%  Prison guards are playing a game. The Nth guard turns the key in every
 %%  Nth cell door, either unlocking or locking the door. A simulated run
 %%  with five guards and five cells would appear thus:
 %% 
 %%  1) Cells 1 2 3 4 5 unlocked
 %%  2) Cells 1 3 5 unlocked
 %%  3) Cells 1 5 unlocked
 %%  4) Cells 1 4 5 unlocked
 %%  5) Cells 1 4 unlocked
 %%  etc...
 %% 
 %%  At the end of the 'game', the program must return a list of unlocked
 %%  Cells, given N Guards and M Cells. 
 %% 
 %%  The jail should be represented as a list of pairs, ordered by cell
 %%  number, in the form [State, Cell], where State is either locked or
 %%  unlocked. To construct an ordered list, Jail, of cells, the relation 
 %%  make_cells(Cells,Start,State,Jail) should be used.
